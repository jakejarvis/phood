# Phood: Status Report 3

1. What was accomplished during the week?

    - We got familiar with Bootstrap and started turning our markups into HTML and CSS. (Thankfully it appears we can use it to make one responsive site for both desktop and mobile, instead of two separate versions.)
    - We began looking into implementing the Foursquare API (more below).
    - We designed a logo and decided on icons to use for pinpoins on the map (bunny and carrots!)
    - We purchased http://phood.at!

2. Challenges and issues team faced during the week

    - We learned that we additionally need to implement the Foursquare API – plugging coordinates into Instagram wasn't giving us the restaurant photos we expected.

3. Your goals for the next week
