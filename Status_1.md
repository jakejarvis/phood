# Phood: Status Report 1

1. What was accomplished during the week?

    - We reevaluated our project and scaled down a few of the features to make it more managable
    - We researched the different APIs and decided to focus on just Yelp, Instagram, and Google Maps
    - We created the necessary accounts to be able to register for and use these APIs
    - We created a team Heroku account and created a new app for our project
    - We did preliminary research on Bootstrap

2. Challenges and issues team faced during the week

    - We tried storing our Heroku app in our Github API, but we got a "page build failure" because GitHub did not like having a submodule inside our repo
    - We need to evaluate how to use Bootstrap to create both a desktop and mobile interface
    - There was a lot to sift through in the Yelp and Instagram APIs, so we need to plan the features we need carefully

3. Your goals for the next week

    - Use the Yelp API to retrieve latitude and longitudes of nearby businesses
    - Plug those coordinates into the Instagram API to get nearby images
    - Begin designing the frontend using Bootstrap and Google Maps

* "We tried storing our Heroku app in our Github API, but we got a "page build failure" because GitHub did not like having a submodule inside our repo" --remove it!
* "We need to evaluate how to use Bootstrap to create both a desktop and mobile interface" --do you need to use Bootstrap? You don't have to, you know.
