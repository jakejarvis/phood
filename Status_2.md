Status Update 2 - 4/17/2015

Accomplishments: 
- Geolocation for the app is functional
- The yelp api has been implemented with consumer key and secret
- A search function has been implemented that finds all restaurants near the userâ€™s location.
- Instagram account is authenticated and got an authorization key
- The Instagram Api is able to search pictures by geolocation using restaurants and longitude. Also, we can filter them using their tags
- These pictures can be displayed on a webpage

Challenges:
- Instagram location api only shows photos from past 5 days, so we need a better way to find photos from restaurants and food pictures aren't always tagged with food related words

Goals:
- Provide a yelp search for a different location that isn't the user's current location (in case that they want to search for an upcoming adventure)
- Provide a yelp search for a location based on the map's current view
- Investigate the foodspotting Api to see if that will yield better photos for our purposes
